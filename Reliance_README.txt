# Reliance Stock Price Prediction

## 📖 Project Overview
This project aims to predict Reliance stock prices using GRU models.

## 🚀 Techniques Used
 
- GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) for faster training and handling short-term patterns  

## 🔎 Methodology
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Training
- Ensemble Prediction
- Evaluation

## 📊 Results
- Achieved high accuracy with low RMSE and MAE

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
```
git clone https://github.com/ArkapratimDas0707/Reliance_StockPrice_Prediction.git
cd Stock_Price_Prediction_Ensemble
```
2. Run the notebook:  
```
jupyter notebook Reliance_StockPrice_Prediction.ipynb
```

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Successfully built an GRU that accurately predicts stock prices.
 
## 🌟 Future Improvements
- Experiment with higher number of epochs if apprpriate hardware is available.
- Add future price prediction using rolling window mechanism. 
- Add more features that might affect stock prices.
- Add sentiment analysis based on news data.  
- Experiment with Transformer-based models.  
- Enhance feature engineering using additional market data.
