# Reliance Stock Price Prediction

## 📖 Project Overview
This project aims to predict Reliance stock prices using a combination of LSTM and GRU models with an Attention mechanism and ensemble learning.

## 🚀 Techniques Used
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for capturing long-term dependencies  
- GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) for faster training and handling short-term patterns  
- Attention Mechanism to focus on key market signals  
- Ensemble Learning for improving prediction stability  

## 🔎 Methodology
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Training
- Ensemble Prediction
- Evaluation

## 📊 Results
- Achieved high accuracy with low RMSE and MAE

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stock_Price_Prediction_Ensemble.git
cd Stock_Price_Prediction_Ensemble
```
2. Install dependencies:  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the notebook:  
```
jupyter notebook Reliance_StockPrice.ipynb
```

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Successfully built an ensemble model combining LSTM and GRU with Attention.  
 
## 🌟 Future Improvements
- Add future price prediction using rolling window mechanism. 
- Add more features that might affect stock prices.
